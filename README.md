# Pokedex

Welcome to Build a Pokedex

We’re going to build a Pokedex in a command-line REPL. We’ll use the incredible PokéAPI to fetch all of the data we’ll need using GET requests. If you’re not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that’s okay! A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.
